FROM KANSAS.                        M U S C A T I N E   W E E K L Y   J O U R N A L

                                                            Muscatine, Ia.
   We have had a conversation with Messrs. James and Joseph Merrit, sons of Mr. John 
Merritt, of Sweetland township in this county, who have just returned from a trip to 
Kansas. They came through by land from Leavenworth, and represent the roads as being 
extremely muddy, and some of the streams so high as to be almost impassable. They 
were nearly a month in making the trip from Leavenworth, being detained by high 
waters. The Pike's Peak excitement, they say, to judge by the numbers arriving at 
Leavenworth, is on the increase. They are of the opinion, however, that those who 
are well situated would do well to remain where they are, and convert their corn 
and wheat fields into gold mines - the most profitable mines, by far, that can be 
worked, as the gold is already coined. 
   Young men, however, who are not engaged in profitable business, can lose nothing 
by visiting the mines, and may, perhaps, make their fortunes. While    _    _    
they were stopping at Lawrence, they met the noted Capt. Montgomery,  /=\""/=\
who, instead of being the blood-thirsty fellow he is represented,    (=(0_0 |=)__
is quite an agreeable gentleman, though a determined man, ready to    \_\  /_/   )
contend for his rights to the last extremity. His actions in Kansas     /_/   _  /\
have been much misrepresented, in their opinion, though they admit     /_/ |_| |_| "
that he is somewhat rash when his ire is provoked. The Messrs Merritt,
we believe, preferring tilling the Iowa soil to delving after the filthy lucre in 
the clayey formation of Pike's Peak, will remain in this county, satisfied with 
their sight "of the elephant."

          AN IMPORTANT BILL
The following bill, to "prevent the intermarriage of white and black races," has 
been offered into our State Legislature, and we trust may become a law.

   Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by 
the authority of the same. That from and after the passage of this act, it shall be 
unlawful for any black man to marry a white woman, or black woman to marry a white 
man.

   Sec. 2. That any person or persons that shall marry in this Commonwealth, 
contrary of the first section of this act, and any justice of the peace, alderman, 
clergymen, minister or any other persons, who shall join in marriage any person 
contrary to this act, and every person who shall be present at such marriage, shall 
be deemed guilty of misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof in any court of 
quarter sessions, having jurisdiction thereof, be fined at discretion of said court, 
in any sum not exceeding five dollars, which shall go one-half to such county as may 
have jurisdiction of such case, and shall be imprisoned in the county jail of such 
county any time not exceeding one year.

   The table published by Secretary of State, concerning the nationalities of 
immigrants from Europe to the United States during the past year, show a marked 
decrease as compared with former years.

   According to the tables, Germany and Ireland forming together about fifty 
millions, are the principal sources from which have flowed hitherto to our shores
the current immigration. - The whole population of Europe consists of over two 
hundred and sixty millions, comprising three principal races. Out of them the 
Teutonic, including England, and the Celtic, from Scotland and Ireland, form 
the principal fountains of immigration, constituting in the aggregate not more 
than eighty millions-,ess, in short, than a third of the entire European population.

   The tables show how altogether insignificant is the immigration from the two 
other races, and above all, the tribes from the other side, such as the Selavic, 
Russian, including Wallachians, Moldaves, Belgarians, Greeks, who amount to more 
than one hundred millions! Equally inconsiderate is the number of immigrants 
furnished by the Latin and Gallic race, forming near eighty millions in the 
European family. 

   The conclusion we draw from these is, that Germany and Ireland have sent to 
our shores the disposable surplus of their population; and that this surplus must 
therefore diminish yearly more and more. The two other members of the European 
family, composing more than two-thirds in number, seem for some reason or other 
not to manifest the same roving and migratory propensities, but are more attached 
to their birth-place or homes and are not, in the future, likely to swell the 
population of America.
