                          The Very Latest from the Gold Mines!

                                South Platte Gold Mines,
                                  Auraria, Jan. '59
Editors Bugle [From the Council Bluffs Bugle] --------------------------------------

   We have six towns already laid off. The first of importance is Auraria, which was 
laid off some time in October, has between 125 and 150 houses built, and logs enough 
on the ground for as many more. If we get stricken off into a New Territory, it will 
be presumed that Auraria City will be the Capital. Denver City is opposite this 
place on the east side of Cherry Creek ; some few houses are erected, and a number 
on the lots already to raise. There is no doubt but it will be quite a place, and 
some future day, will be consolidated with Auraria.

   Highland, is a town very recently laid off opposite here, on the South Platte, 
and is a very pretty town site. Arapahoe City, was laid off by some of the bogs from 
the Bluggs; it is situated at the foot of the Mountains, some 10 or 12 miles from 
here. Mountains, is situated on the South Platte, 7 miles from this city, and is 
quite a place. It was the first town laid off, but it has not the advantages of 
Auraria and Denver Cities, consequently it is not improving very rapidly. 
Russellville, situated some thirty miles up Cherry Creek, was laid off some two 
weeks since. It is situated in the Pineries, and near a good mining district, with 
the advantage of the New Mexico road running through it, no doubt it will be a large 
place, and another advantage it has, the miners off near Pike's Peak, will go in 
there for their supplies, instead of coming down 30 or 40 miles. Auraria and Denver 
will supply miners below and in the mountains, and will be the central points; for 
all kinds of business.
