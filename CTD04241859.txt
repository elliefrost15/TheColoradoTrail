************************************************************************************
MR. EDITOR: — I cannot let this opportunity pass without saying something on the 
subject of the returning immigration. When I went to California in its early days I 
met hundreds on the isthmus who were returning discouraged, and they advised me 
strongly to desist from going on. It is so in this case, men have come here without 
knowing or dreaming of what is required for mining. They expect to find the precious 
metal on the surface or to dig it as they do potatoes at home and one days' 
prospecting in the most improbable localities is enough for them, they hurry back to 
the home---the wife and children they never should have left---we do not need 
nor want such a class of population, what we want is the    ______
resolute, energetic man who comes to stay and work         /     /\
-–in no one instance to my knowledge have such men        /     /  \
been disappointed and I can point you to scores          /_____/----\_    (  
of such you are now reading the report of their          "     "     "    ).  
labor or are waiting contented with what they had       _ ___          o (:') o 
found until the weather permits labor in their         (@))_))        o ~/~~\~ o   
diggings.                                                               o  o  o

   If any man expects to make a fortune here in a few days he had better stay away 
or go away, he will surely be disappointed, but if he will be satisfied with the 
sure, certain and which return for perseverance and industry he will remain with us 
and with almost entire certainty such will be the result. We beg those who are 
coming out to think of this and moreover to know that as yet this country is but 
very slightly prospected, the best diggings known are yet on worked on account of 
the weather, that mines cannot be opened in severe wintry weather, though after 
being opened they can be worked. That there is a field for all who come is true, and
those who choose to labor will be repaid, but for the loafer, the sluggard who 
expects others to do the work and he keep the reward there is no room-–let them stay 
away or go away.

    ,      That many improbable and ridiculous lies have been published about this
  /(  ___________   country is the fact, and the men who have believed them were 
 |  >:===========`  certainly very easily gulled, but should that lying their eyes
  )(                to what they see and know is true, that gold is here and plenty,
  ""    but labor is required to get it. Is it possible that the feat of hard work
is at the bottom of it all. I fear so but will help better things and that they will
at least make out a good strong story to clear themselves, such for instance as one 
man gave, "that Denver City was to be laid in ashes and the inhabitants hung." 

Such a good strong story is that has a relish about it, and we begin to feel a
certain degree of respect for the liar in reflecting upon the sublimity of the lie. 

                                                        Yours truly, H. P. A. SMITH.

MAILS.-We have none, but we hope soon to hear the postman's horn and     /`   `\

   Give us post offices and mails, and we will patronize the

THE INDIANS.-According to the annual report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
presented to Congress, there are within the limits of the United States about 
350,000 Indians, comprised in 175 tribes, with 44 of which we have treaties. There 
have been 393 treaties ratified with them since the adoption of the Constitution, by 
which 581,163,188 acres of land are acquired, and the entire cost of fulfilling them
will be about $49,816,344. From the lands that have been sold, the government has 
received a surplus of at least $100,000,000 above the expense incurred for their 
acquisition, survey, and sale. The whole amount of trust funds held on Indian 
account is $10,870,619.

   A very pertinent inquiry, and one made daily by persons coming through for the 
purpose of engaging in agricultural pursuits is, 'how is the soil adapted for 
                                             _       _/  farming purposes,' or 
                  -\-                       / \  /\  /    'what kind of farming 
                                         ../   \/  \/     country have you.'
                  ./          ./         ./ :                At first sight the soil 
      W|  ,      `|'         `|'         /  `|'           of the prairies presents

      /\         \|/:'       \|/:'          \|/:'         appearance to the farmer, 
     " |"       \|X|/       \|X|/          \|X|/          and he, looks to the 
'''''''''"""'''''''''"""""""""``````````````````````````` bottom lands as his only 
'''''''""""""`````````"""""""""""""`````````````````````` resource.
''''''"""""""```````````""""""""""""`````````````````````    We have conversed with 
''''''""""""""```````````"""""""""``````````````````````` gentlemen who are familiar 
with this country from Ft. Bridger to Los vegas, and are informed that the soil is 
infinitely preferable to that of New Mexico, where grain and vegetables equal to 
such as is raised in the States can be produced.
   Irrigation doubtless will be necessary in some places, but it will be some time 
before such a thing will be necessary, as there is sufficient bottom land to 
accommodate all who will follow agricultural pursuits for some time to come, and the 
upper prairies will be used for stock ranges.
   Almost the entire length of Cherry creek rich prairie lands can be found, and 
along the base of the mountains are as beautiful tracts as can be found anywhere.
   On the divide the Indians have been raising corn for years ; in fact our candid 
opinion is that if this country has only a far trial, it will prove better than the 
most sanguine have anticipated.
