LATEST FROM THE GOLD REGION -----------------------------White Cloud Kansas Chief------
             Arrival of Sheriff E. W. Wynkoop and A. B. Steinberger, Esq. 
                        --- The most reliable Statement---
   The timber is very dense, with stately trees raising to the height of one hundred 
and twenty feet; this is the Nimrods paradise of the West. In the dark solemn depths of 
the forest have roamed undisturbed by the white man, the huge and sullen grizzly, the 
treacherous cougar, or American tiger, the fierce wild cat, while thousands of deer, 
elk and antelope tempt the traveler at every step.

   The mountains are as yet unexplored or prospected; a few have penetrated a short 
distance over rugged steeps, and along deep, yawning chasms, until driven back by the 
snows. The settler at Cherry Creek can only look upon Long's Peak to the North, Pike's 
Peak to the South, and behold them rearing their majestic forms amid the clouds, which 
wrap their summits in silent gloom. He may look up on the dark line of mountains 
between, and only conjecture what vast wealth may be found in the cavernous depths.

   While it is acknowledged that many ridiculous stories are afloat with regard to the 
new Gold Regions, yet destiny has marked out for this great water-shed a mighty future. 
Already the bustle and noise of improvement is heard where once was heard but the tramp 
of the Indian warhorse ; the gleaming axe and burnished ploughshare have taken 
precedence of the scalping knife.

pounds, all depending upon the vim of the ox. These carts are certainly the best 
contrivances for gold hunters to move over the prairies with speed and certainty, that 
we have ever seen, and we feel quite confident that they will be used by the emigration 
in large numbers.

A Cuban Lady's Opinion of the Purchase of Cuba          WHITE CLOUD KANSAS CHIEF

American Gentleman (playfully) -- Do you know Madam, that next year I shall have the 
      pleasure of calling you a fellow-citizen of mine ?
Cuban Lady (indignantly) - Never! Was there so unprincipled a nation ? 
      Because a thing suits you, you think you have a right to steal it.
American Gentleman - Oh, no, Madam ! We don't mean to steal it ; we propose to buy it.
Cuban Lady - Ha, ha ! What ? You buy Cuba ? Why you cannot buy your own Mount Vernon!


Cuba and the West                                      WHITE CLOUD KANSAS CHIEF
   To show the commercial value of Cuban annexation to the West one single fact will 
suffice. The island now consumes half a million barrels of flour a barrel on American 
flour. The annexation of the island to the United States would reduce the price of 
flour to six or seven dollars a barrel, when we have every reason to believe the Cubans 
would purchase a million of barrels for their use a year. For this single article they 
would annually pay our agriculturists six or seven millions of dollars. In other 
commodities, such as meat, butter, lard and olive-oil and whiskey, their trade would be 
equally large. What an impetus such a trade would give our commerce and agriculture.

   A bill passed the Michigan House of Representatives on the 9th inst., amending 
section 25 of chapter 153 of the revised statutes, so as to punish any person 
bringing a colored person into the State, claiming him as a slave, by imprisoning 
not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000.

   The Victoria (Texas) Advocate states that Ned, a free Mulatto -- the Lavacca barber 
-- who speaks the English, Spanish and French languages fluently - is a good penman, 
has traveled in the free States, is thirty years of age, and was made fully 
acquainted with the consequences of his act, has gone into voluntary servitude for 
life, and chosen Mr. E. Clegg, of Lavacca, for his master.

In 1859, the United States and the new territories popping up were caught in a fight
 over slavery, and on the verge of starting the Civil War. Every area and every
person had their own opinion on the matter including Colonel C. W. Jacobs, inducted
as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1860 ... .... ..... ...... ....... ..

   England, who had been foremost in the slave-trade, had now lost her thirteen
colonies and her slaves too ; and soon discovering the rapid strikes we were making in 
agriculture, manufactures and commerce and that civilization and christianity operating 
upon our slave population, made them reliable aids in developing our immense resources 
- determined to frustrate, if she could not destroy, our rapid advancement in wealth 
and power. 

    To this end, George Thompson, an ex-member of Parliament, came over to this country 
in 1832, established presses, and employed agents, and formally organized the New 
England abolition society.

   In 1833 England, being fully enlisted in this crusade against us, bought all the 
slaves on the Island of Jamaica for $100,000,000, and apprenticed them out to planters 
till 1838, when they became absolutely free. - this step on her part was necessary to 
effect her object ; she could then say to us, a-ha, I am holier than thou, imitate my 
example or I will proscribe and denounce you as barbarous and unchristian people. We 
did not follow her example and she has denounced and abused us ever since, because we 
would not ruin ourselves and slaves, as she has done in Jamaica. 

   The great and available argument for the abolition of slavery by England was that 
the freed negroes would become slaves to capital, like the liberated white serfs of 
Europe, and would work cheaper and harder after emancipation than before. The principle 
of humanity never entered into the measure, and the sequel proves how little they know 
of the negro character ; for they refused to work at all, and retired to the forests 
and hills, where they could sustain life on the wild fruits without labor.

   England at once saw the error, and scarcely had the old slaves of Jamaica been 
manumitted, ere she began to introduce new slaves from India, China, the Madeira
Islands and Africa. She calls these slaves apprentices but they are in fact the veriest 
slaves on earth; for the Chinese Coolies are sold and bought in China, just as African 
slaves are. We find by English papers that upwards of 150,000 Coolie slaves have been 
imported from Mauritius within a few years past. 

   The English colony of Jamaica, where they set their slaves free twenty years ago, 
has recently enacted what they call a vagrant law, the design and operation of which, 
is to reduce those free negroes to slavery again! After this, we trust New England will 
not censure our course, since we only follow the lead of Old England abolitionists, 
after testing free negroism to their ruin.
