WHITE CLOUD KANSAS CHIEF --------------------------------------------------------------
The Interior Department has been called upon by the Territorial Committee of the House 
for information concerning the proposed New Territory of Colona or Platte. The reply 
will be communicated to them tomorrow, the 19th, and embodies the following information 
: One year ago, no whites were within the proposed boundaries, except a few trappers. 
the gold discoveries of last year attracted a large number of persons - about five
hundred of whom wintered there. In the coming spring many thousands will no doubt go 
but, and a government will be necessary. The country is mountainous, unfit for 
agricultural purposes, and subject to violent hail storms every year. Gold is found on 
the eastern, and no doubt will be on the western slope of the mountains.

    THE GOLD.
The gold stories continue to come thick and fast. It has been tested in the assay 
office of the mint in Philadelphia, and pronounced to be worth $20.06 per ounce. This 
is the richest gold found in America. The California gold, we believe, is worth only 
about $16 per ounce. Pure gold is worth exactly $24, and the gold that has been 
delivered is the purest gold that has ever been discovered on this continent!

   The new Territory of Colona is thus defined by Mr. Colfax's bill for its 
organization: "The Territory will stretch from the 103d parallel of longitude to the 
crest of the Rocky Mountains, being from four to five degrees in width, and from the 
37th to the 42d parallel of latitude, making it five degrees in length. It will thus be 
nearly square, and will include parts of the Territories of Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and 
New Mexico - nearly all, however, being taken from Kansas. It will embrace within its 
borders not only the gold diggings, but also the famous Three Parks, the headwaters of 
both forks of the Platte, of the Arkansas, and of the Rio Grande.
   St. Vrain's Fort will be near its center. Bridger's Pass, which shortens the road to 
California over one hundred miles, is in the northern part of the new Territory, and 
the Cochatope Pass in the southern."

Just now everybody is destrous of knowing how to keep warm. The following specific, 
which scientific authority recommends as a sure means of keeping warm on cold nights is 
just the thing for this season, when the mercury is almost out of sight : "Put three or
four lumps of sugar with half a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper in a tumbler and fill up 
with hot water; when the sugar is dissolved to drink. It is not only pleasant to the 
palate, but warms the whole body more effectually and quicker than spirits."

             The New Territories of Arizona, Jefferson and Dacotah
            Their Extent, Population, Agriculture and Mineral Riches
               Necessity of their Immediate Organization, &c., &c.
                            Territory of Jefferson
   A bill was introduced in the House on Friday by Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, to 
organize that portion of the national domain embracing Pike's Peak and the adjacent 
country into a Territory, to be called the Territory of Jefferson. 

   Where the people go, there should government and law go hand in hand. The 
difficulties herefore attending the organization and governing of territorial 
governments have been attributable in a great measure to the neglect of the 
government to provide in time proper temporary governments. This was the case with 
California and to prevent a repetition of similar difficulties, Congress should 
immediately see to it that a provisional government is promptly established. Should
Congress fail to do this, then, as a protection against violence and lawlessness, 
the people will be compelled to follow the example of California, and institute a 
government for themselves. 

   It will not do to leave the lives and property of citizens subject to the 
caprices and whims of an irresponsible body of men, who have very little regard for
law or its wholesome and sanitary restraints.

   The proposed Territory of Jefferson - the name which I consider to be very 
happily chosen - will not, it is thought, be a burden to our government. On the 
contrary, it is believed that under the fostering and protective care of the 
government it will be the most productive Territory ever organized. If the 
anticipations of those who have seen the country shall be fully realized, Jefferson 
Territory will pour into the States during the coming and succeeding years millions 
of gold and silver, restoring animation against commerce, manufactures, trade and 
business generally. 

   The organization and development of this country will add more to the substantial 
wealth of the country, more to its stability, more to its glory, than any measure 
now before Congress. It is a measure fraught with incalculable blessings, and one 
which, as much as any other, will add glory to the administration of James Buchanan. 
There should be no delay in its passage. The people everywhere demand it, and the 
voice of the people should be obeyed by their representatives.
