    LATEST FROM THE MINES                    The Kansas News

Mr. C. M. Thompson, of this city, received, on Saturday last, a letter from Doniphan City,
stating that a letter had been received there from Marshall Cook, by his brother, Anderson 
Cook, advising him to leave everything and go to the mines. He stated that he had ten men 
hired, and that he averaged, over and above their wages and other necessary expenses, from
three to ten dollars per day to each hand, and that he has made as high as twenty dollars 
per day to the hand. Marshall Cook is well known to very many of our citizens, as having 
resided here for some time, and all who are acquainted with him place a great deal of 
reliance upon his statements. - St. Jo. Gazette

Mr. Tracy, the company's agent in this city, received a letter from J. E. Brownley, the 
route agent, dated at Louisa, a station near Cottonwood Springs, eighty miles west of Fort
Kearney. The letter states that Pike's Peak is a humbug, and that the four stations west 
of there are full of returning miners. They have no money or provisions in the country but
those belonging to the mail company, the traders in that region having none, and scores 
must literally perish of starvation. There have been no depredations committed yet, but 
the employers of the company are constantly expecting some violence. The writer says the 
provisions of the company must soon be exhausted, but that he cannot see men die on the 
prairies while there is anything to eat. He closes by stating that as he writes the wagon 
and blacksmith shop at the station is crowded with returning Pike's Peakers, and asks the 
company to do something to place the facts before the public, so as to avoid the suffering
and misery that must inevitably ensue. His letter we consider one of the most reliable we 
have seen respecting the gold region, and it gives the most gloomy account of affairs 
connected with the mines.

   No battle had taken place.
   The Austrians apparently exhibited much indecision, and kept occupying places, and 
then abandoning them.
   A bulletin from Vienna explains that the Austrians had taken up a position between 
the Po and Sezia [?] Rivers, to await better weather, before resuming the offensive. 
   The Emperor Napoleon, accompanied by Prince Napoleon, quitted Paris on the 10th for 
Genoa. The Empress is proclaimed Regent during the Emperor's absence.
   The Sardinian General, Del la Marmors, had the river Dora his strategical line.
   The Austrians were fortifying their position on the Sezia.                  .-._______  
   The Austrians were suffering much from sickness.                         .={ . }..--""       *
   The Sardinians were preparing a grand reception for Napoleon at Genoa.  [/"`._.' 
   The Austrians were expected soon to have three quarters of a million of men under arms.
   The Austrians had declared Ancona in a state of siege. The Pope had protested against this action, and Austria was to reconsider it.
   The French at Rome are to be increased and placed on a war footing.
   The last Turin telegraph says that the Austrians were recrossing the Sezia in haste.

Dr. Dick, the celebrated philosopher, says there arises every twelve hours, no less than 
thirty million cubic feet of water, which is more than sufficient to supply all the rivers 
on the earth. This immense body of water is formed into clouds, and carried over every 
part of the continents : and again it is condensed into rain, snow or dews, which 
fertilizes the earth. Should this process pause, we might wash our clothes, but centuries 
would not dry them, for evaporation alone produces this effect : vegetation would wither : 
rivers would swell the ocean : the operations of nature would cease. So close is the 
connection between this process and vegetable and animal life.

The State Sentinel, Democratic Anti Lecompton paper published at Harrisburg, uses the 
following mild language toward the President :
   "He is a violator of pledges, an unwise, unsafe, and corrupt Executive, a Pro Slavery 
Disunionist, a pirate in intention, a tyrant, an apostate from Democracy, a Wool-dyed 
Federalist, and a disorganizer!"
   To which the Philadelphia Pennsylvanian retorts by calling Messrs. Forney and Hickman :
   " Red-mouth Abolitionists, corrupt and rotten at the heart, capable of penetrating the 
foulest and blackest crimes, who have lived all their lives on plunder, stealing from the 
Treasury of the Government, and when the door was shut against their wholesale stealing 
they turn round and abuse the men and party who gave them life."
