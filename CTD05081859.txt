At a meeting held at Holton, Calhoun Co. for the purpose of appointing delegates to 
the Constitutional Convention, a disturbance arose between the potential parties 
present, which resulted in three men being shot.
 ----
   Every day we meet men arriving from the States by the above route -- most of them 
in an almost famishing condition. A few days ago a man arrived at Russellville, and 
reported that his companions - nine in number - had given up and laid down upon the 
prairie some miles distant. A relief party was sent out, who found one of the number 
dead from actual starvation, and two others so far gone that they died soon after 
reaching the settlement.
   A few days later a party of thirteen arrived here who had     __.....__

across the divide to the Platte, by which route the reached   /  __  _  __  \\

                                                              |             ||   _,
   Three days ago nine men reached Fort St. Vrain, whilst we  |             ||.-(_{}
were there, mere tottering skeletons. They stated that they   |             |/    `
had not tasted bread for more than ten days, part of which    |        ,_ (\;|/)
time they had lived upon the flesh of a dead ox, which they \\|       {}_)-,||`
found upon the prairie but partially devoured by the wolves,\\;/,,;;;;;;;,\\|//,
and for four days they had nothing but roots. They stated   .;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
that they traveled more than one hundred miles without     \,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,//
finding water, and most have perished of thirst but for   \\;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,//
some snow squalls that occurred.                          ,\';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;'
                                                             ;;;;;;;;;;;'''`
   All these men tell the same story : that they were 
induced to take the Smoky Hill route by the representations of certain parties in 
eastern Kansas, who employ runners on the steamboats to mislead emigrants by their 
representations, and by distributing circulars and cards purporting to be guides 
over this route, representing it as a good, plain road, with good camps, and two 
hundred and fifty miles shorter than any other route. They are thus induced to start 
out with a short supply of provisions, and learn, when too late, that all of the 
above statements are false -- that there is no road at all, and but little wood or 
water ; that instead of being 630 miles it is full 800, and 600 of it without any 
trail or track of any kind. Great destination prevails all along the latter part of 
the route. Emigrants are wandering over the plains in all directions, discouraged 
and bewildered. Some are striking for the Arkansas, some for the Platte, and others 
still searching for what does not exist -- the Smoky Hill road. Men leave their 
trains to search for a road and are never more seen ; others be down and die and 
become food for wolves.
   One man tells us he knows of seventeen men who have thus perished or disappeared 
; another says the remains of one hundred may be seen along the track they have 
followed.
             .
          \  :  /      We hope the reports are greatly exaggerated, and that time 
           ' _ '        will show the missing are not lost, but we greatly fear the
       -= ( (_) ) =-    worst, and give the reports precisely as they were given to
           .   .       us. This much is certain -- the protruding eyes, the sunken
          /  :  \     cheeks, the trembling knees and cracked voices of many of 
      .-.    '       those we have seen do not lie.
      |.|         What must be the feelings of those who have been instrumental
    /)|`|(\   in turning so large a travel over this route, which at best is but an
   (.(|'|)`)                                 untried experiment. Could they but 
~~~~`\`'./'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    travel over the same road, and look
      |.|           ~~                      upon the bleaching bones and suffer the

     ,|'|.      (_)          ~~          of misplaced confidence, we think they 
      "'"        \"\                 would learn a lesson not easily forgotten.
           ~~     ^~^     Since writing the above we have seen two footmen who have
just arrived via the Smoky Hill route. They appear to have suffered severely from 
hunger and thirst. They report having passed some ten or fifteen bodies unburied, 
(one of them was that of a man named Carpenter,) and many new made graves; also many 
cattle turned loose upon the plains, wagons deserted, and some burned. These men say 
they lived for nine days upon prickly pears and one hawk. Some traveled twelve days 
without seeing wood, and 150 miles without water, except from melting snow, which 
fell twice during their trip.
   "We also had 60 miles of continuous and very difficult sand hills, whilst passing 
over which we picked up three men who had given out and laid down to die of hunger 
and thirst, having eaten nothing for four days ; we fed them and brought them in 
with us."

NY DAILY TRIBUNE       Earthquake at San Jose
Quite a severe earthquake occurred at San Jose at 1 o'clock on April 5. There were 
several vibrations from the north to south and reverse. No damage.

  Grand Rapids, Wi.
A person took the liberty to question M. Dumas rather closely concerning his 
genealogical tree.
   "You are a quadroon, M. Dumas?" he began.
   "I am sir." quietly replied M. Dumas.
   "And your father?"
   "Was a mulatto."
   "And your grandfather?"
   "Was a negro," hastily replied the dramatist, whose patience was waning fast.
   "And may I inquire what your great grandfather was?"
   "An ape, sir," thundered Dumas, with a fierceness that made his impertinent 
interrogator shrink into the smallest possible compass. "An ape, sir, my pedigree 
commences where yours terminates."
